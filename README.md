# Close Bank
Adds a close button to the bottom right of the bank interface for bank standing activities where you deposit all and withdraw a lot.

## Features
- Close button at the bottom right instead of normally top right
- Adjustable button size and position if you want

## Configuration
- Toggle close button
- Adjust button size
- Adjust padding

## Current Issue
- It only closes the interface but not the actual bank, so the interface will go away but you can still deposit :/
